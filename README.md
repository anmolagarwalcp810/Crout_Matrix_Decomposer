# Crout Matrix Decomposition
Given the sequential program for Crout Matrix Decomposition, we parallelize the program using OpenMP and MPI primitives through various different strategies as shown in `strategy[1-4].c`
and compare the performance.

Our report [report.ods](./report.ods) contains details of implementation and performance metrics.
